She Got The Best Of Me
[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it

[Pre-Chorus: Luke Combs]
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a, old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords

[Bridge: Luke Combs]
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So sing a-long

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different sound
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
She got the best of me

[Outro: Luke Combs]
She got the best of me
She got the best of me

Lose It
[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That lit up, ringing, buzzing good for nothing phone in your hands
With directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station, let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Verse 2]
Let's start with them Luccheses
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up
Girl, you don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder as you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it tonight
Yeah girl

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

[Bridge]
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby I swear
Um

[Chorus]
I don't think you know what you're doing to me
You got my heart skip-skipping a beat
You're not close enough so that space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it

Best Shot
[Verse 1]
I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl I'll give you my best shot

[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time, I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singing every time I hear your name
When you smile, I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you

[Chorus]
When you smile, I see the sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm better than I was before you
I'm not saying that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah

Drunk Me
[Verse 1]
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it
But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you)
Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you)
Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound
One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you
And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain
And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink

[Chorus]
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no
Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no
Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no
I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no

Can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do
I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love
I've been sober since you broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me

Sixteen
[Verse 1]
"Take a left here, boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio"
I just rolled my eyes and I said, "Daddy, I know
I'm fifteen, I ain't green like some ol' ten year old"

[Chorus 1]
What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free
Cruisin' up and down Main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm sixteen, sixteen, yeah
Sixteen

[Verse 2]
Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneakin' in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
People talkin' 'bout college and knowledge and that's alright
But all I'm thinkin' 'bout is an unsupervised Saturday night

[Chorus 2]
What I wouldn't give to be eighteen, wild and free
Buzzin' off a can of that Grizzly wintergreen
Lookin' old enough to pull off this fake ID
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm eighteen, eighteen
Eighteen, yeah

[Bridge]
I'm old enough to smoke, I'm old enough to vote
But they turn me away when I go to the Cotton-Eyed Joe
They say the grass is always greener, and I believe that's right
But my friends are off to Vegas, and they're leavin' me behind

[Chorus 3]
What I wouldn't give to be twenty one, wild and free
Open up a cold one and drink it legally
Chase a bunch of girls, go see the world, let my wild streak run
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm twenty one, twenty one
Woah, when I'm twenty one
Yeah, when I'm twenty one, it'll be alright
Yeah, it'll all be alright when I'm twenty one

[Outro]
Now I'm twenty five, and I'm drinkin' wine with my wife at home
Got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
And we sit around, and we laugh about how we used to be

Beautiful Crazy
[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come get me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says 'let's stay on the couch and watch TV'
And she falls asleep

The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool for her

Girl Like You
[Verse 1]
Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me going crazy
I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you

[Verse 2]
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talking slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on

That's ever done it quite like you do

Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
And I don't want to let you go

Last Shot
[Verse 1]
Well, baby love's just one of them words that gets thrown around
Like a Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar, it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, no I ain't gonna lie
If you want to known the truth, how I feel about you tonight

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

[Verse 2]
So baby let me look at you and see just what I got
If you were my cherry stem I'd tie you in a knot
And if I could inhale you, oh baby I'd be gone
I'd be floating round high as the Colorado sky blowing smoke rings all night long

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down

Last call, last chance
Last dance I was ever gonna get to take

[Chorus]
If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold ya
If you were my last night I ever had on wheels, I woulda drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot ya down
Then I'd shoot ya down

This Is It
[Verse 1]
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

[Verse 2]
Girl I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking about
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking about
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is itChris Stapleton
Millionaire
[Chorus 1]
They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

[Verse 1]
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep, as a diamond mine
She's my treasure, so very rare
She made me a millionaire

[Verse 2]
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury"
Sweet luxury

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought no, never could be sold
I got love, enough to share
That makes me a millionaire

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Like riches on a millionaire
When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire

[Chorus 2]
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love, enough to spare
That makes me a millionaireJordan Davis
Take It From Me
[Verse 1]
I think me and you should blow this off
So much for the after-party
Let's tell everybody we got lost
I think me and you should do our own thing
Our own way
At my place, far away

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me

[Verse 2]
Baby, you should stop right now, right here
Right where we wanna be
I'll spin you around and let's just see
Where this thing goes
All I know is that I'm all yours, all night
I've got nothing but time

[Chorus]
So take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulder
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Take it from me, yeah

[Bridge]
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

[Chorus]
Take it from me if you want a t-shirt to sleep in
It's my favorite but you can keep it
Looks good baby, you should leave it
Hanging off your shoulders
Now give me them bare feet dancing down the hallway
Smiling at me, running your finger down the wall
You know what I want, I got what you need
Take it from me
Just take it from me

Take my word, take my heart
Take my kiss and maybe take it too far
But baby take it from me
Oh, just take it from me
But you can steal a kiss, I won't call you a thief
But take it from me
What I got to give you can have for free
Just take it from me

What Makes You Country
[Verse 1]
People talkin' ’bout what is and what ain’t country
What gives ’em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin’ on the rain
We’re all a little different, but we’re all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Verse 2]
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know

[Chorus 2]
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I can't judge
Just be proud of what makes you country

[Brdge]
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out

[Chorus 1]
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb lines
Running bird dogs through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, and that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country

[Outro]
You do your kinda country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us countryJake Owen
Down To The Honkytonk
[Verse 1]
I got a house down a back road
I got a flag on the front proch
I got a dog named Waylon
I got a driveway that needs pavin'
I got a boat with two stroke
I got some 'guaranteed make ya laugh' jokes
I got friends in low places
Yeah, life is what you make it

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me
I might not go down in history
But I'll go down to the honkytonk

[Verse 2]
I got a girl, her name's Shelia
She goes batshit on tequila
I got a job, it gets the job done
I got a loan at the bank; it's a big one
The only place you might see my name
Is on the wall for a good call
I'm a local legend on Friday night
With past blue ribbon and a neon light

[Chorus]
I might not end up in the Hall of Fame
With a star on the sidewalk with my name
Or a statue in my hometown when I'm gone
Nobody gonna name their babies after me

A stray bullet and a momma cries
Her baby won't be coming home tonight
Sirens screaming down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa
Politics and prejudice
How the hell it'd ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no
And so it goes, but I hold onto hope and I won't let go 'cause

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believing there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah I, I believe in the end love wins

Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fighting for, yeah

I, I believe you and me are sisters and brothers
And I, I believe we're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand

Hmm, if ever I get lost in your eyes tonight
Please just let me stay right there a little bit longer
Underneath the stars, we are on fire
And I don't wanna go if you don't wanna go

We can just stay here in this minute
Lose all track of time

So baby, let's just stay here tonight, tonight

Burn Out
Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

Just watchin' rivers run
Down the side of my bottle
Almost like it's cryin' my tears
Had the world on a string
And then I lost everything
And that's how I wound up here

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out

If you put your hands on the flame
You've got no right to complain
'Cause you know it's gonna leave a mark
When the glow comes to an end
Like scattered embers in the wind
Leaves you lookin' for a brand new spark
Watchin' cigarettes burn out

Now with every hit
I'm gonna quit
But who am I kiddin'?
I just can't put you down
So I keep hangin' around

Watchin' cigarettes burn out
'Til all the neon gets turned out
There's nothing left but empty glasses now
It's all flashes now
Smokin' memory that ain't nothin' but ashes
In the low lights
These done-me-wrong songs hit me so right
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn out
I was so on fire for you it hurts how
Fast a cigarette can burn outOld Dominion
Make It Sweet
[Verse 1]
I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Bridge]
Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet
Life is short, make it sweet

Miss Me More
[Verse 1]
I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

I thought I'd miss you
I thought it hurt me
And I'd wanna kiss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
(I miss me more)
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
And I thought I'd miss you

On My Way To You
[Verse 1]
All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

[Chorus]
Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Verse 2]
I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

[Chorus]
Yeah every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

[Outro]
All the boats I’ve missed
All the hell I’ve caused
All the lips I’ve kissed
All the love I’ve lost
I thank God for that
I guess he always knew
I was on my way to you

On my way to you
On my way to youJon Pardi
Night Shift
[Verse 1]
It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day till I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

One That Got Away
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't eat the night
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on Borrowed Time
She's gonna rip off ay kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Verse 2]

She'll leave a scar and a story to tell

She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine

Rumor
[Verse 1]
Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

[Verse 2]
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

[Bridge]
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going roundFlorida Georgia Line
Talk You Out Of It
[Verse 1]
Girl I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice

[Verse 2]
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Verse 3]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it

Never Comin Down
[Verse 1]
I can feel it coming on now
As the music plays
Taking shots with the night owls
As the world just fades away
Got a paycheck in my pocket
'Bout to get it all gone
Light it up like a rocket
We're going all night long

Everybody sing ooh, mmm

Never, ever, never coming down

Then we'll all go rolling home
And maybe we'll keep it going

Coming up right here, right now
I wanna see you move and hear you sing it out loud

Whiskey Glasses
[Verse 1]
Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her

Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

Gettin' over you

A little Friday night hallelujah
A congregation of backsliders just like me
Yeah, what I need

With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'

Baptize me in that barroom smoke
Bartender, preach to me 'til my heart ain't broke no more
Ain't that what this place is for?

But damn did that hurt don't just keep hangin' around
What I need right now

Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'

Just a-sippin' down that unholy water
Save that hurt-like-hell for tomorrow
I'll stay here all night

[Chorus 2]
In a neon church
With the party crowd
Where the good times roll
And the music's loud
Instead of home starin' holes in the ceiling
I got a feeling

I need a neon church
With a jukebox choir
Full of honky tonk angels
With their wings on fire
Straight pourin' out that Johnnie Walker healin'

Eyes On You
[Verse 1]
We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes come to think
I miss them all
And damn babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
With my eyes on you

[Verse 3]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no I didn't care
Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

[Bridge]
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah you guessed it girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on youTyler Rich
The Difference
[INTRO]
Hum hum hum
[Verse 1]
I'm tired sleeping on us
I'm over dodging this crush
I'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just text you back
So you don't get to thinking that I'm too attached
I'm more than benefit friends
I'm more than just a weekend binge
I want you to be my hottie riding shotty
I don't want nobody's body that your body babe
All I'm trying to say is

[Chorus 1]
There's a difference between miss you and I miss your face
There's a difference in what's going on and baby how was your day

There's a difference in love ya and I love you
And I Wanna be the difference
Yeah I do

[Verse 2]
I Wanna be the difference between hey what's up and we gonna do tonight
Between year she's cool we hang out sometimes and that girl right there she's mine
Between leading you on and holding your hand
Sitting it out and girl let's dance
Between playing it safe and taking a chance
Yeah bumping the brakes or hitting the gas

[Chorus 2]
There's a difference between miss you and I miss your face
There's a difference in what's going on and baby how was your day
Yeah there's a hell of difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning to

And I Wanna be the difference

And be the puzzle piece you dint even know you was missing babe
Ohh I wanna be the difference
Yea I do

Oh baby, would you look right there
The way the sun is hitting your hair
The way the world just stopped right here
In mid-air, I don’t ever wanna move

[Verse 2]
You put the cool in the breeze
You put the weak here in the knees
You put me right where I’m supposed to be

Prayed For You
[Verse 1]
I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
Baby you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for youEli Young Band

Good As You
[Verse 1]
See the way you're taking care of your Mama
The way you’re taking care of me
The way you light up any room, girl
You're what this world should be

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

[Verse 2]
Girl, you’re more than just the surface
Yeah, you got that heart of gold
So when it comes to loving you, babe
No, it will never get old

[Pre-Chorus]
Tomorrow, tonight, the rest of my life
I wanna be the man you want me to be
So startin' right now, girl, tell me everything you need

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
Good as you, baby

[Chorus]
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed
Never leave "I love you" left unsaid
In my take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you
I just wanna wake up everyday here in this bed (Yeah with you baby)
Never leave "I love you left" unsaid
It might take a hundred lifetimes to do
But baby, I just wanna be good as you

Homesick
[Verse 1]
Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

[Bridge]
Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby, that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you
I'm homesick for you

People Are Different
[Verse 1]
White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar
Hot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water
Big city, small town, y'all take a look around
People are different
Heavy metal, hip hop, steel toe, flip flops
Sip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot
Accent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth
People are different

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yeah, we all know it's true
But it don't mean that me and you

[Chorus]
Can't walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different

[Verse 2]
Left wing, right wing, jail house, freedom ring
Old school, new school, everything in-between
Like a snowflake, no fingerprint's the same
And people are different

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wish that it was something that we all understood
Lord knows it'd do us all some good

[Chorus]
To walk down a street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
Yeah, people are different

[Bridge]
You can turn on the TV
Change the channel if you don't like what you see
You can get your money back if it ain't your size
You can throw it in the trash if you don't like it
But listen, people are different

[Chorus]
So walk down the street and smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor
No matter what shape, no matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other
Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
If we'd all just embrace the fact
That people are different
People are different
People are different

Bring It On Over
[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby I can't stop thinking 'bout last night
Still taste your kiss, still taste the wine
Tryna to turn this ten minute drive to five
Oh, I've been
Daydreaming 'bout you all day long
Radio's been playing all our songs
Just read your message on my phone
It's turning me on

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

[Verse 2]
I know that key's under the mat
So girl just stay right where you're at
Be right beside you just like that
I want you so bad
Girl let's pick up where we left off
A little more love, a lot less talk
About to hear my footsteps down your hall
Hang on

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

[Bridge]
Wanna see our shadows on the wall
Wanna see your beautiful body
Ain't nobody gonna stop me
I'm about to bring it on over
Bring it on over
Yeah, bring it on over
Bring it on over

[Chorus]
When you say you need me
And you just got to see me
And all you want is me right now
Oh baby just wait a minute
If you're in your bed stay in it
I'm about to dive on in it
Got to got to get you closer
I'm about to bring you on over

[Post Chorus]
Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep
(I'm gettin' closer)
Make a little love to a Motown beat
Catching your groove with me
I'm about to bring it on over

Twisted you up in inside the sheets
I bet you don't get no sleep

Back To Life
[Verse 1]
She got that 'hey y'all' little southern draw that she got from her mama
Likes coffee with her sugar in the morning
She likes to leave little red lipstick love notes on the mirror
Loves the rain on a tin roof when it's pouring

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what we're listening to
Spinning her around the living room
And I fall apart every time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Yes, she does

[Verse 2]
She's got her feet on the dash
Hair blowing back, hand out the window
Making up half the words that she's singing
And she takes an hour to pick a  movie out
Five minutes in and she's passing out
And I wouldn't dare wake her up when she's sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd stay there forever if I could
Doing nothing never felt so good
And I wish that I could stop time

[Chorus]
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life
Oh, yes she does
And I don't wanna think about where I would be without her, oh
She puts that beat in my chest
Pounds like a drum, shakes me like thunder
Taking my hand, pulling me up when I'm going under
My dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes, whoa
Yeah, my dreams come alive when I wake up and look in her eyes
She brings me back to life

[Outro]
Oh, she does
Back to life
