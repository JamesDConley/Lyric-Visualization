Without Me
[Verse 1]
Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

[Bridge]
You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
I already know (I know)
I had to go and find out from them (Oh-woah)
So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there

Broken
[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 1]
I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Verse 2]
There's something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

[Pre-Chorus]
These aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and
That's when she said

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

[Bridge]
Life is not a love song that we like
We're all broken pieces floating by
Life is not a love song we can try
To fix our broken pieces one at a time

[Chorus]
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely
Lonely like me
I could be lonely with you Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper

I Like Me Better
[Verse 1]
To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I don't know what it is but I got that feeling
Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something
Damn

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

[Bridge]
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me, ooh

[Chorus]
I like me better when I'm with you (yes I do, yes I do, babe)
I like me better when I'm with you (oooh noo)
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

You Say
[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'

Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Be Alright
[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine

Love Someone
[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em

Consequences
[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus 1]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus 2]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses

Now it don't even seem like you're tryin'

Used to keep it cool

What if you never smiled at me?
What if I had noticed you too?
And you never showed up where I happened to be

What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would have thought?

What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Verse 2]
What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me? Oh
Of all of the plans that I could have made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh

What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
Getting close to you, but here we are?

What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?

[Bridge]
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)
Is it love? Is it fate?
Where it leads, who can say?
Maybe you and I were meant to be

[Chorus]
What, what
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)
Like two in a million (It's like two in a million), like once in a life, yeah (Woah)
What are the chances? (What are the chances?)

The Sun, it changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar
I could get used to this

Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of

Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun

Used To Be
Still got the same old number
Still drive the car you hate
Still fighting with my father
Still staying out too late
Still leave the back door open
Still let the dog escape
Maybe I'm deep down hoping
You'll come back to yell at me like you used to do
You were right
I'm just a stubborn fool who's living in the past

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes when the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble, baby, holding on to memories
I’ve got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be
I’ve got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be

And when you're at your movie or autobiography
That carries the sweetest details
Feel free to call on me
Write how I made you shiver
The ground underneath us shook
The devil is in the details
He and I get on real good
Like we used to do
And you were right
I'm just a stubborn fool who's living in the past

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes when the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble, baby, holding on to memories
I’ve got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be
Got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be

You know it's ancient history
And if you're having trouble, baby, holding on to memories
I’ve got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be

When we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes when the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble, baby, holding on to memories
I’ve got a king-sized bed and a Ph.D. in the way it used to be

'Cause we were young and we were free
And all your friends were friends with me
Swimming in our clothes when the beach was closed midnight on New Year's Eve
And if you're having trouble, baby, holding on to memories

I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don’t want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can’t part the sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this pull me overboard

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me drown

[Verse 2]
So pull me up from down below
’Cause I'm underneath the undertow
Come dry me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don’t let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me drown
Don't let me drown, drown, drown
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown (Keep my head above water, above water)

[Bridge]
And I can't see, in the stormy weather
I can't seem, to keep it all together
And I, I can't swim, the ocean, like this forever
And I can't breathe

[Refrain]
God, keep my head above water
I lose my breath, at the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep

[Chorus]
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown, it gets harder
I'll meet you there, at the altar
As I fall down to my knees

[Outro]
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Don't let me drown (Don't let me, don't let me drown)
Keep my head above water, above waterBrynn Elliott
Might Not Like Me
You broke up with me and for the life of me
I couldn’t figure out what I did wrong
I’m so sorry, I’m usually the first one
To admit that I did wrong

Get over yourself, it’s no big deal
If I run a little faster than you on the playground
Get over yourself, what’s your problem
What’s your problem?

Well if you don’t like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don’t like girls that are faster than you
And if you don’t like girls that are smarter than you
Well then you might not like me
You might not like me

We had chemistry and you’re one that got away
And I’ll never forget you
You were beautiful, you were perfect as you were
And I didn’t want to fix you

Get over yourself, it’s no big deal
If I swim a little faster than you in the neighbor’s pool
Get over yourself, what’s your problem
What’s your problem?

Well if you don’t like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don’t like girls that are faster than you
And if you don’t like girls that are smarter than you
Well then you might not like me, you might not like me
And if you don’t like girls that are tougher than you
And if you don’t like girls more darin’ than you
And if you don’t like girls braver than you
Well then you might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me and that’s fine by me

Boy, lay down your pride
Wipe that tear from your eye
I’ll take you back, I’ll take you back
Boy, lay down your pride
Wipe that tear from your eye
I’ll take you back, I’ll take you back, boy

Well if you don’t like girls that are stronger than you
And if you don’t like girls that are faster than you
And if you don’t like girls that are smarter than you
Well then you might not like me, you might not like me
And if you don’t like girls that are tougher than you
And if you don’t like girls more darin’ than you
And if you don’t like girls braver than you
Well then you might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me
You might not like me and that’s fine by mefor KING & COUNTRY

All My Friends
[Intro]
I can't get a hold of myself
Breaking all the rules, playing games with my health
My love said I've gone off the rails
I know it's okay 'cause I do it so well

[Verse 1]
I'm in my twenties, living reckless
So turn the hourglass over and let's wreck this
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I make a brand new start
I'm in my twenties, not in a hurry
I got a bulletproof chest so you can't hurt me
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I get a brand new start

[Chorus]
All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm in my twenties, I'm the future
I'm a shaker and I'm a mover
Got a vision coming from afar
Gonna take me back to where you are
I'm in my twenties, not getting restless
Got some hemp now on my diamond necklace
It's a brand new world, I got a brand new heart
And everyday I get a brand new start

[Chorus]
All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

[Bridge]
I can't get a hold of myself
Breaking all these rules
Playing games with my health
And my love said I've gone off the rails
But I know it's okay 'cause I do it so well

[Chorus]
All my friends take good care of me
Wherever I go they bring me home
When I got no place to be
All my friends take good care of me
They get me high, they're on my side
As far as I can see, yeah

Wherever I go they bring me home

Trust My Lonely
[Verse 1]
It's time I let you go
I made the mistake, go writing your name on my heart
'Cause your colors showed
But it was too late, you left me stained, called it art
Do you crave control?
I've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long
So you should go
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

[Chorus]
Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone
Alone, alone

[Verse 2]
There ain't no love 'round here
I loved you once, but it made me dumb
Now I'm seeing it way too clear
You hurt me numb, and for that I've run out of time
To have pain to feel (Pain to feel)
I've been your game
Just taking the blame for too long
Get on out of here
Don't look back, I won't come back
Can't do that no more

[Chorus]
Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

[Bridge]
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know that you're bad for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely
Don't you know you're no good for me?
I gotta trust my lonely

[Chorus]
Go get your praise from someone else
You did a number on my health
My world is brighter by itself
And I can do better, do better
You and I were swayin' on the ropes
I found my footing on my own
I'm a-okay, I'm good as gold
And I can do better, do better alone

One Drink
[Verse 1]
You were the best thing
And I was so investing
And I need you tell me
That you're not too far gone
And I should've learned my lesson
When you heard that I was texting
Her and all my exes
And now you're too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be here arms open
But you made it clear that you're not coming

[Chorus]
So I'll need more than one drink to get over you
And I know it's not the right way to cope and
I don't know how to handle my emotions
One drink to get over you
And I know that I'll regret it in the morning
It's the bottle not my heart that I've been pouring, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh love, oh love, oh love
One drink, oh love

[Verse 2]
And I need someone else to
Help me to forget you
Use her body as a refuge
Before I'm too far gone
Can't stop looking at the pictures
That we took when I was with you
Yeah, we had something special
But now you're too far gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be here arms open
But you made it clear that you're not coming

[Chorus]
So I'll need more than one drink to get over you
And I know it's not the right way to cope and
I don't know how to handle my emotions
One drink to get over you
And I know that I'll regret it in the morning
It's the bottle not my heart that I've been pouring, yeah

One drink, two hearts, three words, I'm in love

[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
With you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Verse 1]
It was all so overwhelming
She was like, "I don't know, don't tell me"
He had eyes that said, "Girl, I'll save you"
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true

[Verse 2]
Waves were breakin' on that shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past four
Still I yearned to touch you more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (You, you)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm s'posed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
And ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (Aye)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through

Connection
[Verse 1]
These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna just connect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely?

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Verse 2]
Real friends, good friends – hard to find, let's face it
Buy the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now, but I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40 years
And I be ready and willing and able to edit the story
Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

[Chorus 2]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Refrain]
Lonely

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, man searching for the real thing
Need somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

[Chorus 3]
It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
