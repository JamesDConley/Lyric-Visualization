I like that you're broken
Broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely

I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off

Think I could love you, but I'm not sure
There's something wholesome, there's something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I'd love to meet

These aren't my people
These aren't my friends

[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?

I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')

The Sun, it changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar

Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountaintop that I'm dreamin' of

Zero
[Verse 1]
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't want to hear about what to do
I don’t want to do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

[Verse 2]
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

[Refrain]
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don’t want to hear about what to do, no
I don't want to do it just to do it for you

Love It If We Made It
[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone

And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

I know you're clingin' to the light of day
To tell you everything's A-okay
And medication don't do much
Yeah, it just numbs the brain

I'm on the bright side of bein' hell bent
So, take it from me, you're not the only one
Who can't see straight (Can't see straight)

But you gotta try, and I'm callin' out

Get up, get up, what's takin' so long
Get up, get up, get a move on

Get up, get up, ain't nothin' wrong
'Cause I believe you can be whatever
And I agree you can do much better, trust me (Trust me)

So, Marvin Gaye, "What's Going On?"
Ain't nothin' normal when it comes to you and me
I'd rather twist myself in knots than watch you give up on your dreams

Don't sell yourself short, you might be bulletproof
Hard to move mountains when you're paralyzed

Alone I try with words unspoken
Silent cry, my breath is frozen

Taking time just one step forward

[Chorus]
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them
And they don't care who you are
They don't care what you do, no
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them

[Verse 2]
My heart and I don't get along
It's something that I'm sad about
Everybody needs a pick me up
But I should probably slow it down
But it's pretty good company
It cheers me up when I feel bad
These are my insecurities
That keep me going

[Chorus]
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them
And they don't care who you are
They don't care what you do, no
These are my friends, these are my friends
I love them, I love them

We are the weirdos
Inflated egos
The filthy misbehave
The ones you dream of
The ones you can't shake

These are my friends, these are my friends

Are You Ready
[Intro]
Are you ready?
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up, get up

[Verse 1]
Well, are you ready now for the revolution?
For too long your power has been taken away, it's been taken away
Does your heart feel heavy now? Savor the solution
Take those mental shackles off and throw them away
You've got to get them out of your mind
Don't you let their vision leave you blind

[Verse 2]
Moving steady now, it's a revelation
For so long your focus has been taken away, now you're breaking away
They may think they know you, but here's an education
No, they can't control you once you've broken away
They're done patrolling your mind
When they're searching for you, they will find
A force they aren't ready for

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon

[Verse 3]
That's enough already now, you don't wanna take it
All your reservations have been taken away, they've been taken away
So you think you're ready now for the revolution?
Yeah, they can't control you once you've broken away
You've got to get them out of your mind
When they stand before you they will find
A force they aren't ready for

[Chorus]
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?

You've got to get them out of your mind

They aren't ready for you to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for you to be turned into someone who cannot be preyed upon
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to be strong
Are you ready?
They aren't ready for us to prove them wrong
Are you ready?
Let me know you're ready to be turned into people who cannot be preyed upon

Mantra
[Verse 1]
Do you wanna start a cult with me?
I’m not vibrating like I oughta be
I need a purpose, I can’t keep surfing
Through this existential misery
Now, we gonna need some real estate
But if I choose my words carefully
Think I could fool you that I’m the guru
Wait, how do you spell “epiphany”?

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
‘Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Could I have your attention, please?
It’s time to tap into your tragedy
Think you could use a new abuser
Close your eyes and listen carefully
Imagine you’re stood on a beach
Water gently lapping at your feet
But now you sinking, what were you thinking?
That’s all the time we have this week

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Too late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one
‘Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra

[Bridge]
And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense
But do you really wanna think all by yourself now?
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith
You know it’s easy to believe
And I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense
You know you gotta work the corners of your mind now
All I’m asking for’s a little bit of faith
You know it’s easy to, so easy to believe

[Chorus]
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off
Before you find a place to be, you gonna lose the plot
Before the truth will set you free, it’ll piss you off

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight

Movement
[Verse 1]
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

[Verse 2]
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

[Pre-Chorus]
When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

[Chorus]
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove

Fast Talk
[Verse 1]
Me and my best friends cruising down West End Street
Hiding from cops and driving circles around the block all week
All of my friends died out on West End Street
They say we're born to die young
But we're just trying to live in peace

[Chorus]
So maybe heaven is a ghetto with no bad blocks
Shangri-La dealers at the bus stops
And maybe god is just a cop that we can fast talk
So if you're guilty and you know it, put your hands up
'Cause karma's just a different word for bad luck
And what if death is just another pair of handcuffs?
Then we'd better run
Then we'd better run

[Verse 2]
All of our friends went crazy on LSD
Sailing their cars through the big bright city streets
And everyone who knows our name
Says that we ain't ever gonna change
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way
They say we're born to die young
But we're trying to find a better way

There's a light in you that tears me down to nothing
There's an angel in your eyes
There's a hope inside that you can make it better
You see right through my disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
When it rains it pours and everybody stumbles
I won't let them bring you down

[Chorus]
I won't let you down
When the seasons change
I won't go down
I'll fight through the pain
I'll be there right by your side
I'll never let them bring you down
When the seasons change

There's a hope in me that I will die for something
Was the fire in my eyes
All this pain inside, will it be this way forever
I can run but I can't hide

I won't let them bring me down

All Out Life
[Verse 1]
What a world, the horizon's
Coming like a hell-bent killing machine
Can't afford to be the goddamn wreckage
Burn it all again at a million degrees
Calling all the adamant upper-level
Undefeated counterfeit cunts with a reason to fear
Throw away all the meaningless shit that's clinging
The enemy is here, I said stop

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
One by one against, give me the name
All you shiny pretty never-wills ruined the game
You hold all the keys, so the chains shouldn't hold you
I know you heard me, I fucking told you

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
No excuses, I challenge you to all out fucking life

[Verse 2]
Drop that shit and put it on a pedestal
Children are afraid of the gods
Raise your hands and show me what's impossible
That makes us even, never tell me the odds
What a bore, I'm getting stuck in a metaphor
I don't wanna go to sleep
I need a breakdown quick in negotiations
Get it all together and remember to seethe, stop

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Give it to three
I'm gonna show you how to do it if you know what I mean
Drive by violence, more of the same
I can see where you're going, and I'm really ashamed
Do you think when you act or just act like you're thinking?
I gotta know now, you better tell me

[Chorus]
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said
Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
We are not your kind
I challenge you to all out life

[Bridge]
We are gathered here today to get it right
Repeat after me:
"I will not celebrate mediocrity
I will not worship empty shells
I will not listen to worthless noises
I will not subject myself to selected predictable choices
My time, my attention
My quality should not be bought and sold
For convenience's sake, ever"

Yours does not mean mine, kill does not mean die
Pay attention, it's gonna be a while 'til I really feel alright
Old does not mean dead, new does not mean best
No hard feelings, I'm tired of being right about everything I've said

If I fall again, will it be the end?
I know it's wrong
You think I'm strong, but I just pretend
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

Stuck at the surface
Not making progress
Falling apart
Well I'm trying my hardest
Looking for answers
Finding a rope
Is the noose getting tighter?
I'm losing control

Will the end make me whole again?

When my grip is lost
I still feed my insecurity when I know the cost
Is it taking over?
Will it bury me?
Or will clarity become the cure for my disease?

Careful what you wish for
We're looking for angels in the darkest of skies
Saying that we wanted more
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm trying to fly
Where does all the good go?
We're looking for answers in the highest of highs
But will we ever, ever know?

[Chorus 1]
And I need you to know, I'm not asking for a miracle
But if love is enough, could you let it show?
If you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, ohh) If you feel it could you let me know?
(Oh, ohh) I'm not asking for a miracle

[Intro]
Move!

[Verse 1]
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode

[Verse 2]
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or a secret door
What are we here for
If not to run straight through all our tormentors?
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Bridge]
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost

[Chorus]
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else
I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

[Outro]
Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun

Do Not Disturb
[Verse 1]
I think we should make out
In a few hours I'm getting on a plane
There's a pretty safe bet you'll never see me again, yeah
I love your accent
I wonder what it'll sound like when you cum
Let's see if Blondes or Brunettes are more fun

[Chorus]
I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed, but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
And if I were you I'd bring your girlfriend, too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb
Ah

[Verse 2]
Let's take our clothes off
I wanna show you my hidden tattoo
That nobody ever gets to see but you do
Oh baby let me taste ya, shake ya, tie you up and break ya
'Cause I've been alone, left on my own for too long
Oh damn, too long, too long, too long, I say come on

[Chorus]
I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed, but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
And if I were you I'd bring your girlfriend, too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb

[Bridge]
Put a sign on the door
Turn all the lights off
I left sign on the door
I take all your clothes off
There's a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturb

[Chorus]
I'm on the very top floor room 1334
There's a king size bed, but we can do it on the floor
Turn your cellphone off, leave a sign on the door
That says "Do not disturb"
And if I were you I'd bring your girlfriend, too
Two is better than one, three is better than two
Leave a sign on the door, the whole night through
That says "Do not disturb"
Do not disturbImagine Dragons
Boomerang
[Verse 1]
How many lies do we have to tell?
To keep from saying, that I wish you well?
How many times I said I'm movin’ on?
How many times that false alarm goes off? (Goes off)
Goes off? (Goes off)
I know I'll see you tomorrow

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You’re my boomerang, boomerang

[Verse 2]
How many tears do we have to cry?
How many sleepless, lonely nights?
To work it out, is it worth it now?
Should we go ahead?
Or should we turn around?
I know I’ll see you tomorrow

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go
Lettin' you go, lettin’ you go
Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on
I'm ready to go, ready to go
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang

[Bridge]
Just because it isn't easy doesn't mean that it is wrong
Everything that we've been working on, working on so long
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
You're my boomerang, boomerang (Ooh)
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boome-boome-boomerang-rang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Lettin' you go, lettin' you go (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Moving on, moving on (Boomerang-rang)
Ready to go, ready to go (Boomerang-rang)
I'm ready to throw, ready to throw
You're my boomerang, boomerang
You're my boomerang, boomerang
